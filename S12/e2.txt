Try to connect from the Browser. What happens? Could you see the web page? (is the page green?)

If you change the content of the page from html to plain, if you search for it in the browser, the body appears just
as it was programmed, it doesn't get translated.
With the html, the server translates the message so that you can see the page in green, and exactly how you were
intended to see it in the first place.
